# cbz-merge

## Warning - This is an early build and has no safety checks in place. Use at your own risk.

cbz-merge will convert your multiple .cbz files for one comic/manga and create one big .cbz file. 

### Why?

So you can convert to a suitable filetype for your e-reader and not litter the library with multiple files. 


### TODO
- ~~Add logging so users can see what happened during the run.~~
- ~~Implement 'ebook-convert'~~
- Allow a user to pass the directory at runtime.
- Add flags - Ex - Flag to ZIP a directory of JPEGs to CBZ.
- Add safety checks to prevent accidental zipping.
- Clean up unzip after run.
