# cbz-merge

## Warning - This is an early build and has no safety checks in place. Use at your own risk.

cbz-merge will convert your multiple .cbz files for one comic/manga and create one big .cbz file. 

Why?

So you can convert to a suitable filetype for your e-reader and not litter the library with multiple files.
